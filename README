# Arduino Zigbee Communication
This Arduino code enables bidirectional communication between two Arduino boards using Zigbee modules.

## Functionality
1. Setup():
Initializes two UART serial connections: one on the standard port (UART0) and the other on Serial1 (UART1), both set at a baud rate of 9600. Upon startup, it sends the message "Test zigbee" over the standard serial connection to indicate the start of Zigbee communication testing.
2. Loop():
The loop() function handles both sending and receiving data via Zigbee in a continuous loop.

* Sending:
If data is available on the standard serial connection (Serial), it reads it byte by byte and sends it over the Serial1 connection. Data is stored in an array until a carriage return ('\r') character is received, indicating the end of a message. Then, the contents of the array are sent via Serial1, and the array is reset for the next message.
* Receiving:
If data is available on the Serial1 connection, it reads it and sends it over the standard serial connection (Serial), allowing for data reception from the other Arduino board.

## Usage
Upload this code to two separate Arduino boards equipped with Zigbee modules.
Ensure both Zigbee modules are properly configured.
Open the serial monitor for each Arduino board to monitor communication.

## Note
Adjust baud rates and other configurations as needed to match your specific hardware setup.
Ensure proper power supply and connections for reliable communication between the Zigbee modules.
